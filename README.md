A 2D Unity Game Project in the context of a Game Development school project

## The Goal

**Improve my Drawing Skills:** \
Although IÂ´ve always found drawing and art in general really interesting, I terribly suck at anything which has to do with art and I want to change that.

**Get into Game Development:** \
I've always loved video games and their technical aspect so I want to get to know the Topic

## The Idea

**Improving Drawing Skills**: \
The main idea behind this project is that I force myself to draw each and every Sprite by hand myself.

**Finding proper inspiration and ideas for my game**: \
  Obviously, as a solo developer in this project, I can't come up with every story aspect and mechanic myself so I'm getting a little help by AI and friends.

## How I work

**The Drawing Part:** \
I want to learn drawing but I have no interest in drawing my graphics on paper so I use my ***5th Gen. Ipad Pro 12.9*** with an ***Apple Pencil 2nd Gen.*** and ***Goodnotes 5*** to draw. ****(see examples below)****

**The Editing Part**: \
After I finish drawing an abomination of an Asset, I screenshot the drawing and send it over to my ***MacBook Air M1 2020*** (which I use for all the work for this project, including Unity). I then open up the screenshot in ***Adobe Photoshop*** and use the eraser tool to remove all the excess from the "paper", but still leave a rather thick outline to get the handdrawn style of the game. ****(see examples below)****

**The Coding Part** \
Due to me being a 4th year IT student, I was already able to gather plenty of coding experience, so the coding part (although I'm rather unexperienced with C#), should be the least of my worries.
